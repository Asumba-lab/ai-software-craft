# Ethical Reflection
When deploying predictive models in a corporate setting, it’s crucial to acknowledge and mitigate bias. For instance, a breast cancer prediction model might be biased if trained on datasets lacking demographic diversity (e.g., underrepresentation of certain age groups or ethnicities). Such bias can lead to inaccurate or unfair prioritization in resource allocation.

In software engineering, this can manifest in unequal system responses, skewed priorities, or missed edge cases affecting minority teams. If the model predicts issue urgency and consistently deprioritizes reports from certain departments due to data imbalance, it perpetuates systemic bias.

Tools like IBM’s AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) help detect and mitigate such bias. AIF360 can evaluate disparate impact, identify fairness metrics across groups, and recommend remediation strategies (e.g., reweighting, sampling, or post-processing).

Integrating fairness tools ensures ethical AI practices and builds trust in intelligent systems. As engineers, it is our duty to not only optimize performance but also uphold fairness and equity in software solutions.
