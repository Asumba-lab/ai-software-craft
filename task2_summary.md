# Word Analysis
AI-powered test automation tools like Testim.io and Selenium with AI plugins significantly improve test coverage and reduce human error. In this assignment, I created a Selenium test script to validate login functionality using both valid and invalid credentials.

Traditionally, manual testing of login forms can be repetitive and error-prone. With AI-enhanced tools, elements can be auto-detected and adapted even after UI changes. This allows tests to remain valid without constant manual updates.

The test captured screenshots and logged results. Valid credentials led to a successful redirect, while invalid ones triggered an error message as expected. This confirms the login logic functions correctly across use cases.

In conclusion, AI-enhanced automation improves test stability, accuracy, and speed. This is especially valuable in large systems with frequent UI updates, ensuring regressions are caught early with minimal effort.
